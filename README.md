A chatbot trained on my facebook messanger data. My approach has changed pretty dramatically over time, and you can see my thought process by checking out my blog posts. Currently, I'm now writing it in tensorflow using the cornell movie dialog database as my training data, which I then plan to use as the base for transfer learning when I train the model again, this time with my facebook data. I'm using tensorflow so that I'll be able to easily convert it to a javascript file which I can host on a github pages website for free.
